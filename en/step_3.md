## Develop - Repeat the shapes

The design uses six intersecting hoops, and each hoop is moved out from the centre and rotated a different number of degrees. 

--- task ---

In the final design, there is no central hoop: the hoops are all moved out from the centre.

First, `translate`{:class="blockscadtransforms"} (move) the first hoop into position.

Now the hoop is a little off-centre.

--- task ---

You need multiple copies of this hoop, rotated around the centre. First, create three equally spaced hoops:

Add a `count`{:class="blockscadloops"} loop to create three hoops. To space the hoops, add a `rotate`{:class="blockscadtransforms"} block between the `count` loop and the `translate` block. `Count` sets the `i` variable from 1 to 3. `Rotate` moves each hoop by `120 Ã— i` degrees, so the the three hoops are distributed equally around the 360 degrees of a circle (360 / 3 = 120).

Look at the code and make sure you understand how it works.

The finished design has six hoops rather than three. Change your code so that it creates six equally spaced hoops.

Change the `count`{:class="blockscadloops"} loop so that it runs six times instead of three. The six hoops will need to be equally spaced around 360 degrees.

You need to change the loop to run from 1 to 6 and move in multiples of 60 degrees (360 / 6 = 60):

Your code should look like this:
