## Introduction

In this project, you will use BlocksCAD to design a 3D pendant. The pendant uses a geometric design based on the 'Flower of Life', a design which is often found in historical art. 

BlocksCAD is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a desktop computer or tablet. You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing.

If you have access to a 3D printer, then you can print your pendant. The pendant is small and only uses a little bit of filament, and it is quick to 3D print.

### What you will make

The finished pendant looks like this:

The pendant has a hoop on top so that you can put it on a necklace or cord. 

The pendant has a diameter of 40mm, plus the hoop for hanging. It is 2mm thick, so it will 3D print quite quickly.

After this project, youâ€™ll also be able to code your own design and create a custom pendant.
