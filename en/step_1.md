## Define

You want to make some custom jewelery; something unique that only you will own. Thanks to 3D printing technology, this is now possible and relatively easy to accomplish.

## Discover

In this project the pendant you will make, will look like this:

However, once you have the skills, you will be able to design your very own pendant. Have a look at some of [these designs](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+printed+jewellery&tbm=isch&chips=q:3d+printed+jewellery,g_1:geometric:q-53194p1cU%3D&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjr3IGPgb_nAhVL1eAKHZVwBxYQ4lYoAXoECAEQFw&biw=1061&bih=1765), to give you some inspiration for what you can make.

## Design

Get a piece of paper, and sketch out some ideas for your own custome pendant. They don't have to be final designs, but just something to give you some inspiration.

## Decompose

There will be several stages in creating your pendant.
1. Create an initial 3D shape
2. Use repetition to create a pattern of shapes
3. Create a frame around the shapes
4. Create a way of attaching the pendant to a necklace
5. 3D print your finished pendant
6. Use the skills you've learned to design your own pendant.
