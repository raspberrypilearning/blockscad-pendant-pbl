This is a perfect project for learners to adapt what they have learned to create their own designs. If you have the time available allow them to create their own pendants.

Scaling can be an issue on a learner's designs. Before exporting to STL format, ensure that their print size is not microscopic, or the size of a car.

If you need to print this project, please use the [printer-friendly version](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blockscad-pendant/print){:target="_blank"}.
