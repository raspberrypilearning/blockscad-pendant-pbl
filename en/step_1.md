## Define

You want to make some custom Jewellery; something unique that only you will own. Thanks to 3D printing technology, this is now possible and relatively easy to accomplish.

## Discover

In this project the pendant you will make, will look like this:

However, once you have the skills, you will be able to design your very own pendant. Have a look at some of [these designs](https://www.google.com/search?q=3d+printed+jewellery&tbm=isch&chips=q:3d+printed+jewellery,g_1:geometric:q-53194p1cU%3D&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwjr3IGPgb_nAhVL1eAKHZVwBxYQ4lYoAXoECAEQFw&biw=1061&bih=1765), to give you some inspiration for what you can make.

## Design

Get a piece of paper, and sketch out some ideas for your own custom pendant. They don't have to be final designs, but just something to give you some inspiration.

## Decompose

There will be several stages in creating your pendant.
1. Create an initial 3D shape
2. Use repetition to create a pattern of shapes
3. Create a frame around the shapes
4. Create a way of attaching the pendant to a necklace
5. Use the skills you've learned to design your own pendant.
6. 3D print your finished pendant

This is a perfect project for learners to adapt what they have learned to create their own designs. If you have the time available allow them to create their own pendants.

Scaling can be an issue on a learner's designs. Before exporting to STL format, ensure that their print size is not microscopic, or the size of a car.

If you need to print this project, please use the [printer-friendly version](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blockscad-pendant/print){:target="_blank"}.
