BlocksCAD 3D can export an `.STL` file for 3D printing.

Render your model and then click **Generate STL**. Remember where you save the STL file.

--- task ---

3D print your pendant using a filament of the colour of your choice.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Very carefully remove the 3D print from the print bed. The pendant is thin, so it's quite delicate. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---		

You might need to remove small strands of filament (especially from the hanging hoop) to tidy up the print. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---		

Thread the pendant on a chain or cord. If you want to use a thicker cord or necklace, then you can adjust the design to have a larger hanging hoop.
