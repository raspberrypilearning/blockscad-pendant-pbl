3D print your pendant using a filament of the colour of your choice.

--- task ---
Very carefully remove the 3D print from the print bed. The pendant is thin, so it's quite delicate.

You might need to remove small strands of filament (especially from the hanging hoop) to tidy up the print.

--- task ---		
Thread the pendant on a chain or cord. If you want to use a thicker cord or necklace, then you can adjust the design to have a larger hanging hoop.
