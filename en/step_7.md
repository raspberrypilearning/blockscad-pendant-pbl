## Challenge: Create your own pendant

Now that you understand how to place repeating shapes, you can try and design your own pendant.

To begin with why not just change the initial shape that is repeated, or the number of repetitions.

Then, go back to your original designs and see if you can recreate one of them, or maybe just make something brand new!
