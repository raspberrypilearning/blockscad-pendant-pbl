## Challenge: Change the pendant

--- challenge ---
The design is influenced by the 'Flower of Life' pattern. If you like, you could research the 'Flower of Life' and see if you can create a design based on the 'Seed of Life' pattern.

Experiment and change some values in your pendant. For example, change the number of hoops, or the rotation. 

You could also try to use cuboids (cubes) instead of cylinders to create a pattern.
